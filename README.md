##Installation

Install Node.js. Easiest way is to install it from https://nodejs.org/,
but do whatever you got to do.

Got node? Good, go into the project and run the following command:

    npm install

This will install all the dependencies for the project.

##Development

To develop on the project, run the following:

    npm run serve

You can then see the project, by going to the following:

    http://localhost:4200

##Build

To build the project, run the following:

    npm run build

This will create a dist directory in the root of the project. This is
what would be used for the final version of the site.
